Blocks the specified user from following the authenticating user. In addition the blocked user will not show in the authenticating users mentions or timeline (unless retweeted by another user). If a follow or friend relationship exists it is destroyed.

The URL pattern /version/block/create/:screen_name_or_user_id.format is still accepted but not recommended. As a sequence of numbers is a valid screen name we recommend using the screen_name or user_id parameter instead.
