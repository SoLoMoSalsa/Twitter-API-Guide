Returns the top 50 trending topics for a specific WOEID, if trending information is available for it.

The response is an array of “trend” objects that encode the name of the trending topic, the query parameter that can be used to search for the topic on Twitter Search, and the Twitter Search URL.

This information is cached for 5 minutes. Requesting more frequently than that will not return any more data, and will count against your rate limit usage.

The tweet volume (tweet_volume) for the last 24 hours is also returned for every trend.

Please note that Ads API developers have an increased rate limit on this endpoint at 50 queries / 15 minutes / token.
