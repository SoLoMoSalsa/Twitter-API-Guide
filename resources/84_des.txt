Created a new place object at the given latitude and longitude.

Before creating a place you needed to query GET geo/similar_places with the latitude, longitude and name of the place you wished to create. The query will return an array of places which are similar to the one you wish to create, and a token. If the place you wished to create wasn’t in the returned array you could use the token with this method to create a new one.
